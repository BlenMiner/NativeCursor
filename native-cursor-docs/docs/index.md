## What is Native Cursors?

Native Cursors is cross-platform package that allows you to change the cursor to any of the available cursors on the OS.
This is useful for games that want to use the OS's cursor instead of a custom one.

Currently, it supports **WebGL**, **Windows**, **MacOS** and **Linux**.

## How does it work?

It relies on P/Invoke to call the native APIs of each platform.
